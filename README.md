This Tableau project focuses on understanding the impact of social media usage on students. The dataset includes information such as time spent online, favorite social media platforms, purpose of usage (entertainment, study, chatting), effects on sleep, mood, academics, and addiction levels.
Using Tableau, the raw dataset was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to generate meaningful insights. The dashboard allows users to filter data by age group, gender, platform, and usage duration.
The goal of the project is to identify: Which platforms are most commonly used
How many hours students spend on social media daily
Whether usage impacts academic performance, sleep, productivity, or mental health
Which age groups show early signs of addiction# Social-Media-Usage-Analysis-Tableau-
